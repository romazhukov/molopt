The base aug-cc-pV(Q+d)Z is constructed via the original (v0)
data from the BSE

  * Al-Ar come from "aug-cc-pV(Q+d)Z"
  * H-Mg come from "aug-cc-pVQZ"
  * Optimize general is applied

The comparison reference files for the xxx-cc-(Q+d)Z also comes from
v0 (with optimize general applied).

aug-cc-pVDZ comes straight from v1. This is used to test how it works with transition
metals and Ga-Kr. Then, xxx-cc-pVDZ references are manually created from aug-cc-pVDZ
